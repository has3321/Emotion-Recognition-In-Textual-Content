# Emotion-Recognition-In-Textual-Content

Project Overview
The goal of this project is to develop a system that can accurately detect emotions from textual data. Emotion recognition is useful for various applications, including customer feedback analysis, sentiment analysis, and personalized marketing. We achieved a 95% accuracy using a pre-trained BERT model fine-tuned on the dataset.

Dataset
We used a publicly available dataset from Kaggle, which contains labeled text data for different emotions. The dataset was processed and cleaned for optimal model performance.

Models Used
Dummy Classifier: A simple baseline to evaluate the project's effectiveness.
Logistic Regression: A classic machine learning model used for baseline comparison.
BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers): A pre-trained transformer model fine-tuned on our emotion dataset, achieving 95% accuracy.
